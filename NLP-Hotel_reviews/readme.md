## Sentiment analysis on hotel reviews dataset:

### Overview
In this project, i will be using Natural Langauage processing techinique to process hotel reviews and develop a model which will be able to tell whether the reviews are positive or negative.

This project walks through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature generation, model development and summary.

### Objective:
To develop a NLP model which will take input as customer reviews and gives output as positive or negative.

### Business Problem:
One of the biggest problems that many companies have been trying to overcome is how to take advantage of all the data collected from guests. The amount of data has challenged the travel industry. One type of data is reviews left by guests on websites such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Yelp.

This project will build a model that can correctly predict if a hotel review is negative or positive so that hotels can input their reviews and get a non-biased score from any website, which will turn the review analysis uniform. Although the model will be trained with reviews from over ...... hotels, it can be used for any hotel to predict if a review is positive or negative correctly.

### Dataset:
The dataset for this project was originally used in the study Text Mining in Hotel Reviews: Impact of Words Restriction in Text Classification by Diego Campos, Rodrigo Rocha Silva, and Jorge Bernadino and a team at the University of Coimbra. You can find the paper here. The raw dataset is from Kaggle. Since some datasets were large, you can download the CVS files here. The original dataset had 515,738 observations and 17 columns. It's important to mention that this dataset was collected from Booking.com, a website where you can book hotels. It's a great dataset because it contains real reviews that we can use to train our model so that our model will be able to read real-life reviews and predict if they are good or bad.
